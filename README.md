# msrhmn’s Dotfiles 🐧

A Simple, and quick Ubuntu desktop setup, just things that work.

### What this is
My personal dotfiles for a fast, minimal, and stable Ubuntu daily driver so that I don't have to bother for update's or a new installation.

### Distro & Environment
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (currently)
- Default GNOME Terminal
- Shell: Bash with a few quality of aliases
- Editor: VS Code, vi when I’m on a server or in terminal
